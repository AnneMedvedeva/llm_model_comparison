However, **as of today (October 26, 2023), Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla.**\n\nWhether he will still be CEO in 2025 is uncertain. There are several factors that could change this:\n\n*   **His own decisions:** Musk could choose to step down or focus more on his other ventures like SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), or Neuralink.\n*   **Board decisions:** The Tesla board of directors could decide to replace him.\n*   **Legal or regulatory issues:** Unforeseen legal or regulatory challenges could impact his ability to lead the company.\n*   **Company performance:** If Tesla were to significantly underperform, there could be pressure for a change in leadership.\n\n**Therefore, while Elon Musk is the current CEO, it's impossible to definitively say who will be CEO in 2025.** You'll need to follow news and company announcements closer to that time to get a definitive answer.",
