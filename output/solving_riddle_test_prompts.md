The owner was originally 37 ri behind the thief and was able to close the gap to 23 ri after traveling 145 ri. This means the owner was able to shorten the distance between them by 37 - 23 = 14 ri.

To catch up completely, the owner will need to cover the remaining 23 ri ahead the thief and also the 14 ri that were closed in the previous 145 ri.

Therefore, the owner will need to travel an additional 23 ri + 14 ri = 37 ri to catch up with the thief.

Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given information:
   • The thief was initially 37 ri ahead
   • The owner traveled 145 ri
   • At this point, the thief was still 23 ri ahead

2) Let's define some variables:
   • Let x = the additional ri the owner needs to travel to catch the thief

3) Calculate the thief's total travel distance:
   • Initial head start = 37 ri
   • Thief's total travel = 37 + 23 = 60 ri

4) Calculate the owner's total travel:
   • Owner's travel = 145 + x

5) When the owner catches the thief, the total distances traveled by both will be equal:
   • 60 + x = 145 + x

6) Solve the equation:
   • 60 + x = 145 + x
   • 60 = 145
   • x = 145 - 60
   • x = 85

7) Check the solution:
   • Thief's travel = 37 + 23 = 60 ri
   • Owner's travel = 145 + 85 = 230 ri
   • Both traveled 230 ri relative to their starting points

Therefore, the owner will catch the thief after traveling an additional 85 ri.

The answer is 85.

Let's verify the key steps:
• Thief started 37 ri ahead
• Owner traveled 145 ri
• Thief was 23 ri ahead at that point
• Owner needed to travel 85 more ri to catch the thief
• Thief traveled a total of 60 ri
• Owner traveled a total of 230 ri (145 + 85)

## Step 1: Determine the distance the thief traveled when the owner traveled 145 ri.
The thief was initially 37 ri ahead when the owner started chasing. When the owner traveled 145 ri, the thief was still 23 ri ahead. This means the thief had traveled a certain distance that kept him 23 ri ahead after the owner covered 145 ri. Since the owner closed the gap from 37 ri to 23 ri by traveling 145 ri, the distance the thief traveled during this time can be calculated by subtracting the initial lead from the final lead and adding this to the owner's distance traveled.

## Step 2: Calculate the distance the thief traveled while the owner traveled 145 ri.
The owner reduced the gap from 37 ri to 23 ri, meaning he effectively closed the gap by 37 - 23 = 14 ri. Since the owner traveled 145 ri to close this 14 ri gap, and considering the thief also moved during this time, we can deduce the thief's travel distance by understanding that the difference in their speeds resulted in this 14 ri gap closure.

## Step 3: Determine the ratio of the owner's speed to the thief's speed.
The distance the thief was ahead initially and finally, and the distance the owner traveled, gives us a way to calculate their speed ratio. The owner traveled 145 ri to close the gap by 14 ri (from 37 ri to 23 ri ahead for the thief). This implies the thief traveled 145 ri - 14 ri = 131 ri during the same time the owner traveled 145 ri, because the owner's travel plus the reduction in lead equals the total distance the thief would have traveled to maintain a 23 ri lead after the owner's 145 ri chase.

## Step 4: Calculate the ratio of speeds.
The ratio of the owner's speed to the thief's speed is 145 ri (owner's distance) / 131 ri (thief's distance), which simplifies to 145/131.

## Step 5: Determine the distance the owner needs to travel to catch up.
Since the thief is 23 ri ahead when the owner has traveled 145 ri, and we now know the ratio of their speeds, we can calculate how much farther the owner needs to travel to catch up. The owner needs to close the remaining 23 ri gap.

## Step 6: Use the speed ratio to find the distance the owner must travel to close the 23 ri gap.
Given the owner's speed to the thief's speed ratio is 145/131, and knowing the owner must close a 23 ri gap, we can set up a proportion: 14 ri (closed gap) / 23 ri (remaining gap) = 145 ri (distance to close 14 ri gap) / X ri (distance to close 23 ri gap). However, the correct approach should directly utilize the speeds' ratio to find the additional distance the owner must travel to close the 23 ri gap at their relative speeds.

## Step 7: Correct approach to find the additional distance the owner must travel.
The owner travels 145 ri for every 131 ri the thief travels, meaning for every 14 ri the owner closes the gap, he travels 145 ri. To find out how far the owner travels to close a 23 ri gap, we can set up a ratio based on the speeds or directly calculate based on the distance the owner needs to cover to close the gap at the rate he is gaining on the thief.

## Step 8: Calculate the additional distance using the ratio of distances traveled.
Since the owner closes 14 ri of the gap by traveling 145 ri, to close 23 ri of the gap, we use the proportion: 145 ri / 14 ri = X ri / 23 ri. Solving for X gives us the additional distance the owner must travel to catch the thief.

## Step 9: Solve the proportion for X.
\[145 / 14 = X / 23\]
\[X = (145 \times 23) / 14\]
\[X = 2335 / 14\]
\[X = 166.79\, \text{ri}\]

However, my calculation approach deviated from directly applying the speed ratio to find the exact distance the owner needs to travel to close the remaining gap based on their relative speeds. The critical insight is recognizing the owner's speed advantage and applying it directly to the remaining gap.

## Step 10: Correct Calculation.
Given the owner's speed is greater, we find how much distance the owner covers to the thief's distance. The correct approach involves using the ratio of the owner's speed to the thief's speed to calculate how much longer it takes for the owner to cover the 23 ri gap at their relative speeds. Given the owner travels 145 ri to the thief's 131 ri, the calculation should focus on the relative speed advantage of the owner.

The final answer is: $\boxed{166.79}$

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about a horse theft where the owner is chasing the thief, and we need to determine how much farther the owner must travel to catch up after certain distances have been covered. Here's how I'll approach it:

### Understanding the Problem

We have two main characters:
1. **Thief**: Stole the horse and has a head start.
2. **Owner**: Starts chasing the thief after the thief has already traveled 37 *ri* (a traditional unit of distance).

After the owner travels 145 *ri*, they find out that the thief is still 23 *ri* ahead. Now, we need to determine how many more *ri* the owner must travel to catch up to the thief.

### Defining Variables

Let's assign some variables to make this clearer:
- Let the speed of the owner be \( V_o \) *ri* per unit time.
- Let the speed of the thief be \( V_t \) *ri* per unit time.
- The initial head start of the thief is 37 *ri*.

### Analyzing the Given Information

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - Thief starts 37 *ri* ahead.
   - Owner starts chasing.

2. **After Owner Travels 145 *ri***:
   - Owner has traveled 145 *ri*. The time taken by the owner to do this is \( t_1 = \frac{145}{V_o} \).
   - In the same time, the thief has also been moving. The distance the thief travels in \( t_1 \) time is \( D_t = V_t \times t_1 = V_t \times \frac{145}{V_o} \).
   - The thief's total distance from the starting point is initial head start plus distance traveled while being chased: \( 37 + V_t \times \frac{145}{V_o} \).
   - At this point, the owner is at 145 *ri*, and the thief is \( 37 + V_t \times \frac{145}{V_o} \) *ri* from the start.
   - The distance between them is given as 23 *ri*. So:
     \[
     \left(37 + V_t \times \frac{145}{V_o}\right) - 145 = 23
     \]
     Wait, this seems off. Actually, the owner has traveled 145 *ri* from their starting point, and the thief is at that moment 23 *ri* ahead of the owner. So the thief's position is:
     \[
     145 + 23 = 168 \text{ *ri* from owner's start}
     \]
     The thief initially had a 37 *ri* head start, so the distance the thief traveled while being chased is:
     \[
     168 - 37 = 131 \text{ *ri*}
     \]
     So, in the time the owner traveled 145 *ri*, the thief traveled 131 *ri*.

   This gives us the ratio of their speeds:
   \[
   \frac{V_t}{V_o} = \frac{131}{145}
   \]
   So, \( V_t = \frac{131}{145} V_o \).

### Determining the Catch-up Point

Now, we need to find out how much more the owner needs to travel to catch up to the thief. At the point where the owner has traveled 145 *ri* and the thief is at 168 *ri*, the distance between them is 23 *ri*.

Let’s say the owner travels an additional \( x \) *ri* to catch up. The time taken for this is \( t_2 = \frac{x}{V_o} \).

In that time, the thief travels \( V_t \times t_2 = \frac{131}{145} V_o \times \frac{x}{V_o} = \frac{131}{145} x \).

At the catch-up point, the distances they've traveled from the owner's starting point are:
- Owner: \( 145 + x \)
- Thief: \( 168 + \frac{131}{145} x \)

Setting them equal at catch-up:
\[
145 + x = 168 + \frac{131}{145} x
\]
Now, let's solve for \( x \):

Subtract \( \frac{131}{145} x \) from both sides:
\[
145 + x - \frac{131}{145} x = 168
\]
\[
145 + \left(1 - \frac{131}{145}\right) x = 168
\]
\[
145 + \frac{14}{145} x = 168
\]
Subtract 145 from both sides:
\[
\frac{14}{145} x = 23
\]
Multiply both sides by \( \frac{145}{14} \):
\[
x = 23 \times \frac{145}{14}
\]
Calculate \( 23 \times 145 \):
\[
23 \times 145 = 23 \times 100 + 23 \times 40 + 23 \times 5 = 2300 + 920 + 115 = 3335
\]
Now, divide by 14:
\[
x = \frac{3335}{14} \approx 238.214 \text{ *ri*}
\]
But since we're dealing with exact values, let's see if 3335 is divisible by 14:
- 14 × 238 = 3332
- 3335 - 3332 = 3
So, \( \frac{3335}{14} = 238 \frac{3}{14} \) *ri*.

However, since we're likely expecting an integer answer, let me check if there was a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, in the initial setup, when the owner traveled 145 *ri*, the thief was at 168 *ri*, meaning the thief traveled 131 *ri* in that time (from initial 37 *ri* head start). 

The relative speed is:
Owner gains \( V_o - V_t \) distance per unit time.
At catch-up, the owner needs to cover the 23 *ri* gap, with a relative speed of \( V_o - V_t \).

We have \( V_t = \frac{131}{145} V_o \), so:
\[
V_o - V_t = V_o - \frac{131}{145} V_o = \frac{14}{145} V_o
\]
Time to catch up after being 23 *ri* behind:
\[
t = \frac{23}{V_o - V_t} = \frac{23}{\frac{14}{145} V_o} = \frac{23 \times 145}{14 V_o}
\]
Distance owner travels in this time:
\[
x = V_o \times t = V_o \times \frac{23 \times 145}{14 V_o} = \frac{23 \times 145}{14} \approx 238.214 \text{ *ri*}
\]
Same result.

Given that, and since the numbers seem correct (145 - 131 = 14, which is the speed difference ratio), it appears the answer is indeed \( \frac{3335}{14} \) *ri*, which is approximately 238.214 *ri*. 

But perhaps the numbers are intended to be whole numbers; let's see:
3335 ÷ 14 = 238 with remainder 3, so 238 and 3/14, which is 238.214.

Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the distances is interpreted differently. 

Wait, another way to look at it is:

Initial gap when chase starts: 37 *ri*.
After owner travels 145 *ri*, gap is 23 *ri*.
So, the owner has reduced the gap by 14 *ri* (from 37 to 23) by traveling 145 *ri*.

This means for every *ri* the owner travels, they close \( \frac{14}{145} \) *ri* of the gap.

To close the remaining 23 *ri*:
\[
x = \frac{23}{\frac{14}{145}} = 23 \times \frac{145}{14} = \frac{3335}{14} \text{ *ri*}
\]
Same calculation.

Given that, unless there's an error in initial interpretation, the answer is \( \frac{3335}{14} \) *ri*.

But since the original distances are integers, maybe the answer is expected as a fraction or decimal. 

Given no alternative, the exact answer is \( \frac{3335}{14} \) *ri*, which is approximately 238.214 *ri*.

However, looking back at the original numbers, maybe the issue is in interpreting the initial head start and the distances.

Alternative interpretation:
Thief starts 37 *ri* ahead.
Owner starts chasing, travels 145 *ri*, at which point the gap is 23 *ri*.

So, owner's position: 145 *ri* from start.
Thief's position: initially 37, so after being chased, let's say thief has run an additional y *ri* when owner runs 145 *ri*.

Then:
Owner: 145
Thief: 37 + y
Gap: (37 + y) - 145 = 23
37 + y = 168
y = 131

So, in the same time, owner runs 145, thief runs 131.
Speed ratio: \( \frac{V_t}{V_o} = \frac{131}{145} \)

Now, to catch up from 23 *ri* behind:
Relative speed: \( V_o - V_t = V_o - \frac{131}{145} V_o = \frac{14}{145} V_o \)
Time to catch up: \( t = \frac{23}{\frac{14}{145} V_o} = \frac{23 \times 145}{14 V_o} \)
Distance owner travels in that time: \( x = V_o \times t = \frac{23 \times 145}{14} \)

So, same answer. 

Given that, the most precise answer is \( \frac{3335}{14} \) *ri*, which is approximately 238.214 *ri*. 

But since the numbers seem correct, perhaps the answer is intended to be exact.

### Final Answer

The owner needs to travel an additional \( \frac{3335}{14} \) *ri* (which is approximately 238.214 *ri*) to catch up with the thief. 

Expressed exactly:
\[
\frac{3335}{14} \text{ *ri*} = 238 \frac{3}{14} \text{ *ri*}
\]

However, since the calculation consistently leads to this result and no simpler integer seems to fit, the answer is:

**The owner needed to travel \( \frac{3335}{14} \) ri more to catch up with the thief, which is exactly 238 and \( \frac{3}{14} \) ri.**

Let $x$ be the total number of ri the thief traveled until the owner caught up with him.
Let $y$ be the total number of ri the owner traveled until he caught up with the thief.
When the owner started, the thief had traveled 37 ri.
After the owner traveled 145 ri, the thief was 23 ri ahead. This means that the thief had traveled $145 + 23 = 168$ ri.
The thief's total distance traveled is $37$ ri initially, plus the distance traveled while the owner traveled 145 ri. Let the distance traveled by the thief in this time be $d$ ri. Then $37 + d = 145 + 23$, so $37 + d = 168$, which means $d = 168 - 37 = 131$ ri.
Let the ratio of the owner's speed to the thief's speed be $r$. Then we have
$$\frac{145}{131} = r$$
Let $z$ be the number of more ri the owner traveled to catch up with the thief. Then the total distance traveled by the owner is $145 + z$ ri.
The total distance traveled by the thief is $168 + w$, where $w$ is the additional distance the thief traveled when the owner traveled $z$ ri.
We have $145 + z = r(131 + w)$.
In order for the owner to catch up with the thief, they must have traveled the same distance. Therefore, we have
$145 + z = 37 + 131 + w$
$145 + z = 168 + w$
$z = 168 - 145 + w$
$z = 23 + w$
Now we have
$\frac{z}{w} = \frac{145}{131}$
$131z = 145w$
$131z = 145(z - 23)$
$131z = 145z - 145 \cdot 23$
$145z - 131z = 145 \cdot 23$
$14z = 145 \cdot 23$
$z = \frac{145 \cdot 23}{14}$
$z = \frac{3335}{14} \approx 238.21$

We have $y - x = 0$ when the owner catches the thief.
Let $u$ be the distance the thief traveled in the time the owner traveled 145 ri. Then $u+37 = 145 + 23$, so $u+37 = 168$, which implies $u = 168 - 37 = 131$.
Then the ratio of the owner's speed to the thief's speed is $\frac{145}{131}$.
Let $n$ be the number of additional ri the owner traveled to catch up with the thief.
Then the distance the thief travels in the same time is $n \cdot \frac{131}{145}$.
The owner caught the thief when $145+n = 37+131+n\frac{131}{145}$, so $145+n = 168+n\frac{131}{145}$.
$n - n\frac{131}{145} = 168-145$
$n\left(1-\frac{131}{145}\right) = 23$
$n\left(\frac{145-131}{145}\right) = 23$
$n\left(\frac{14}{145}\right) = 23$
$n = 23 \cdot \frac{145}{14} = \frac{3335}{14} = \frac{476.42 \dots}{2} \approx 238.21$ ri.
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{238}$
